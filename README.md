# InformalOnt
An ontology for the informal sector of the economy.

This project is a work on Ontology Development for representing the Informal Sector workers, employers and jobs offered by those employers to the workers, and to empower these people in the process. Inspite of being the sector of economy employing a major portion of the population, it remains the sector with the least available technology for advancements, and hence more cases of unemployment. This is basically due to the lack of job information on both the worker and employer sides.

Since many informal sector workers are freelancers, their information needs to systematically stored, updated and made available to people (prospective users). Similarly, jobs available need to be listed and made available to workers to contact the respective employers. This can be done by using an ontology that stores worker, employer and job information, and can be used to map workers to a job and vice versa.

That is why, we created InformalOnt, an ontology to empower the Informal Sector Workforce. It can sufficiently specify the details of their skills, competence, education and personal information and the jobs that can be offered to them. InformalOnt has been evaluated based on standard metrics and domain coverage and also through reasoners. These evaluations showed how the proposed model surpasses existing ontologies in the domain of job recruitment for both formal and informal sector of the economy by being complete, coherent, concise and consistent with the domain.
